This dataset contains order information from instacart. It is organized
by order and contains information about the products ordered, as well as
information about the customer (i.e. how long it’s been since they last
ordered). It contains 1384617 observations and includes columns for
order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. For example,
the first order in the dataset was made by 112108 at 10 o clock and we
can see they ordered c(“Bulgarian Yogurt”, “Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole
Milk Cottage Cheese”, “Organic Celery Hearts”, “Cucumber Kirby”,
“Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil”, “Bag of Organic Bananas”,
“Organic Hass Avocado”, “Organic Whole String Cheese”) (of which
c(“Bulgarian Yogurt”, “Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk Cottage Cheese”,
“Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil”, “Organic Whole String Cheese”)
were reordered).
